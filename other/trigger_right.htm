<font class="Helvetica32" face="Arial" size="2"><u>Introduction</u><br>
  Whenever a player activates a <i> trigger</i>, it causes some actions on one or more
  <i>receivers</i>. A trigger can be an <i>event</i>, <i> object</i> or <i> hero</i> that a hero
  visits, or it could be an ERM <i> function</i> called by other ERM code or even a
<i>
  timer</i> set up to trigger at a specific time or interval (e.g., every 14 days).
Receivers can be events, heroes, map objects or other things. Since many things
in the game can be used as a trigger or receiver, it's important to not confuse
which is which.<br>
<br>
<u>How to Use Triggers</u><br>
The properties of the trigger event
  or object do not matter for purposes of it being a trigger. The action of the
  trigger must be described in a <i> timed event</i>. In an ERM script, the
trigger functions as the header, and following after the trigger on
subsequent lines are one or more receivers that are executed one at a time in
sequence. If you place more than one trigger in the same timed event, it's
important to realize that there is no &quot;end trigger&quot; code; a new
trigger signals the end of one triggered script and the start of the next.<br>
<br>
<u>Trigger Syntax</u><br>
Every trigger begins with an exclamation mark/question mark combination (!?) and
ends with a semicolon (;). Immediately following the !? is a two-letter
trigger name which must be entered in capital letters, e.g., BA, OB or HE.
Following the trigger name are one or more parameters shown as # in the list
below. Each parameter notation (#) must be replaced by an integer number in your
code, e.g., <font color="#FF0000"><b>!?HE47;</b></font>. The meaning and allowable range of these numbers is
different for each type of trigger. For the HE trigger, the number is the hero
number (the number used by the&nbsp; game to reference a particular hero), while
for the LE trigger, the numbers specifies the x, y and level coordinates of a
local event on the adventure map.<br>
<br>
<u>Using Variables in Triggers</u><br>
Trigger-based local variables:<br>
<br>
y-1...y-100 are integer vars<br>
e-1...e-100 are floating point vars<br>
<br>
You may use them in the same places that you use y and e vars now.<br>
<br>
Specific features:<br>
1. They are NOT saved in the saved game. Actually every trigger section will run
completely and you cannot save and load a game being inside a trigger section.<br>
2. These vars are local for every trigger and if even one trigger works out
inside another trigger section, they will have a different set of vars. As you
can see you cannot pass values from trigger to trigger using these vars.<br>
3. All vars are set to 0 at any trigger start, so you can use this as a default
value.<br>
<br>
<u>Duplicate Triggers</u><br>
If the exact same trigger is used more than once in a map, ALL receivers
following all occurrences of that trigger are executed, starting with the first
trigger (earliest timed event and first trigger reference within that event) and
ending with the last trigger.<br>
Note that !?BA0; is a different trigger from !?BA1; and likewise !?HE47; is a
different trigger from !?HE48;.<br>
<br>
<u>Conditional Triggers</u><br>
A condition can be added to a trigger so that the receivers following it only
execute if the condition is true. To do this, place an ampersand sign (&amp;)
immediately after the last parameter and before the semicolon. After the &amp;,
put your conditional statement. This statement must consist of either a flag or
a variable followed by a comparison symbol (=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, or
&lt;&gt;) and either a second variable or an integer value.<br>
<b><font color="#0000FF">Example:</font></b> <font color="#FF0000"><b>!?BA0&amp;v10=51;</b></font>
This means that the receivers following the BA0 trigger will only execute if v1<span lang="de">0</span>
has a value of <span lang="de">51</span>. You can include multiple tests as well by separating each
subsequent condition check by a slash (/) e.g., !?BA0&amp;v10=51/v2&gt;=5; The
BA0 trigger receivers will now only execute if v10 is equal to 51 and if v2 is
equal to 5 or higher. See the <a href="variable.htm">Flags and Variables section</a>
for more details about flags, variables and conditional checks. Adding a second
trigger of the same type but with a conditional check part way through a script
is one easy way of only executing the rest of the script if certain conditions
are true.</font>

     It does not work for backpack.<br>
     If you change one artifact to another, it produces some extra<br>
          triggers call. Here it is:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. AE0 (prev)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. AE1 (prev)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. AE0 (prev)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 4. AE1 (new)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 5. AE0 (new)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 6. AE1 (new)<br>
     If you take an artifact from a backpack and a slot that this<br>
          artifact may be placed is busy, you will get the next sequence for<br>
          every slot this artifact may be placed:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. AE0 (prev)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. AE1 (prev)<br>
     So be careful and do not count that if a specific artifact is<br>
          not taken off, you will not have AE0 trigger switched for this art.</font></td>

        <b>Network service: </b>!?BG and !?BF work at both sides and if the variables are the same, they 
        will give you the
        identical effect at both sides.
        Only user related actions are not synchronous for both sides and 
        BA0/BA50 and BA1/BA51
        triggers make a difference.<br>
        New BA triggers:<br>
        # = 52 - called at a battle start at both sides<br>
        # = 53 - called at a battle end at both sides<br>
        So at a battle start:<br>
        1. If it is an attacker's PC (or non MP game) BA0 is called<br>
        2. If it is a defender's PC BA50 is called<br>
        3. BA52 is called.<br>
        At battle end:<br>
        1. If it is an attacker's PC (or non MP game) BA1 is called<br>
        2. If it is a defender's PC BA51 is called<br>
        3. BA53 is called.<br>
        <br>
        This means that if you want to have an identical code for BA0 and BA50, 
        you just need to make<br>
        one section with BA52 header.<br>
        <br>
        NOTE. If you want to test scripts in MP mode you cannot do it at the 
        first game turn (day 1).<br>
        You need to pass one day so all players will have an identical 
        environment.</span></font><br>

<b>Post Instruction.</b>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  This trigger works out a bit later than instruction are executed but
after the majority of settings are done for the map.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The other specific thing here is that this trigger works out ONLY
if you start a new game but not if you load a saved game (so the same
way as instructions do).<br>
<font color=blue> <b> Example:</b></font><br>
<font color=red size=2><b>ZVSE<br>
!#IF:M^Instr^;<br>
<br>
!?PI;<br>
!!IF:M^Post Instr^;<br></b>
</font>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you start this map, you will have two messages: "Instr" and then
"Post Instr". When the first message appears, almost no settings are
done for the map and when the second message appears, the most
settings are done already. If you load a saved game, you will have no
messages at all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;  1. You could use the TH1 trigger to check for a new building built in a town.<br>

          <br>
          &nbsp; <u>Note:</u><br>
          1. A new round starts between BG0 and BG1.<br>
          2. *BR(0) may have two form. If a player has a tactic phase, this will
          be:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; BG0-BG1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; BR(0)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; Though if AI has a tactic phase, this will be:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; BG0-BR(0)-BG1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; So if you do not use BG1 trigger it will be the same.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; I did not test it for both AIs and both players, but
          think this<br>
          will be the same cases.</font></p>
