  <br>--> <p align="left"><B>I</b><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong><b>ntroduction</b></strong><br>
  Flags and variables are at the very heart of the ability of ERM to transform Heroes into a highly dynamic game that responds to the actions
  and choices made by the players. While ERM scripts can be written without using flags or variables, learning to use them will greatly enhance
  your options, and in fact, a number of the commands require their use.<br>
  <b><strong><br><A name="fintro"></a>Conditional Flags</strong></b><br>
  Conditional Flags are also referred to as <i>flags</i> or <i>CFs.</i> A flag is a conditional switch that is either true (1) or false (0).
  Like a binary digit, it has only two states and no other. Initially, all flags are set to false (0). A value of 1 (true) is sometimes referred
  to as the flag being "set" while a value of 0 (false) is sometimes referred as a flag being "not set".<br>
  </a></font><a name="FLAGS"></a><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">
  <B><u><a name=fset></a>Setting</a> Flags </u></B><br>In ERM, there are 1000 conditional flags and these are each represented by a number from 1
  to 1000. Flags are set with the </font> </a> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <a href="../receiver/reif_r.htm#v">IF receiver</a> using the V# command.
  To set a flag to true, use the value 1 and to set it to false, use 0.</font><br>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">Example:</b></font>
<script type="erm">!!IF:V4/1;set flag 4 to True</script>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to the V command, there are also several IF commands for setting the first 10 flags all
 at once. Refer to the <a target=_parent href="../receiver/reif.htm">IF receiver page</a> for the specific syntax of these commands.<br>
 </font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">
  <B><u>Using Conditional Fla<A name="fcheck"></a>gs</u></B></font><br>
  The most common use of a flag is to control whether or not a piece of ERM code (such as a trigger or receiver) executes under certain conditions
  in the game. For example, if you want a map object to display a message the first time any hero visits it but never after, you could use a flag
  for this purpose; it would display the message if the flag was false (not set) and a following command would then set the flag to true (1)
  so that next time the object was visited, no message would be displayed.The symbol for indicating a flag (or variable) test is the ampersand (&)
  which is placed immediately prior to the colon of a receiver statement, or prior to the semicolon of a trigger statement. The ampersand is
  immediately followed by the flag number used for the test. If a test for a true flag (a flag that has been set to 1) is made, the number alone
  is used. If the test is for a false flag (not set, or set to 0), a negative sign is placed in front of the number. So to test if flag number 5
  is true, you would use &5, and to test if flag number 5 is false, you would use &-5.<b><br>
  <font color="#0000FF">Example:</font></b><script type="erm">ZVSE
  !?OB10/14/0; [object at x=10,y=15,level=surface is visited by a hero]
  !!IF&-5:M^Come in.^; [display if flag 5 is false]
  !!IF:V5/1; [set flag 5 to 1 (true)]</script>
  
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><B><u>Checking Multiple Flags</u></B><br>
  At times, you may want to check for more than one conditional flag (or variable). To do this, separate each subsequent number with a slash (/).
  When there are multiple flags or variables to test for, ALL conditions must be met before the statement executes. For example, if you were
  testing for flag number 7 being true, flag 8 being false and flag 10 being true, then if even one of those flags had a different value,
  the statement would not be carried out.<br>
  </font><b><font color="#0000FF">Example:</font></b>
  <script type="erm">ZVSE
  !?OB10/14/0; [object at x=10,y=15,level=surface is visited by a hero]
  !!IF&7/-8/10:M^Come in^; [The message is displayed only if flags 7 and 10 are true and 8 is false]</script>
</font><b><font color="#008000" face="Arial" size="2"></font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><B><u>Initializing Flags</u></B><br>
While all flags initially begin as "not set" (i.e., value of 0 or false), flags 501 to 1000 will retain their last value when you begin a new
  map (or the same map over) without first quitting and restarting the Heroes game. This is so they can be used for making campaigns in which
  you want certain flag values to carry over to the next map in the campaign. If you wish to avoid potentially having flags that aren't set to
  0 at the start of a game, either stick to using flags 500 and below or initialize to 0 at the start of your map or script (with IF:V statements)
  all flags that you wish to use.<B>
  <u><A name="fspec"></a>Special</A> Flags</u></B><br>
There are several flags that have special significance in the game.
<br><b>Flag 1</b> is used by certain commands to return a result and will also return the result of a conditional check of values (see below).
 Therefore, it's a good idea to never use flag 1 for any long term storage. Or to be safe, don't use it at all and stick to higher numbered flags.
<br><b>Flag 996</b> is automatically cleared (set to False) when any !!LE command executes and is set to 1 (True) if there is no Placed Event at
 the location specified by the LE command (you know that a Placed Event is removed after usage sometimes).
<br>
<b>Flag 997</b> and <b>998</b> are set as follows:
<br> <b>Flag 997</b> returns the MP state of a battle.<br>
 =0 (False) if we have a local battle<br>
 =1 (True)  if we have a network battle<br>
If <b>Flag 997</b>=1, then Flag <b>998</b>=0 if an AI attacks a Human player at a remote PC.<br>
  Note that the battle here runs at only ONE PC, but this PC is a distant one for the current active PC. <br>
<b>Flag 998</b>=1 if we have a Human vs Human battle. Here we have a real MP battle.<br>
You may use both flags in BA0 or BA50 trigger like this:
<script type="erm">!?BA0&997/998;
...Here we go if this is a Human vs Human MP battle</script>

<b>Flag 999</b>, which is set to 1 if the current player (when trigger executes) is a player is "here" and 0 if he or she is at another PC.
 The AI has it always set to 0. If flag 999 is set, you can be sure that this is human and he is here. It's working for all triggers. <br>
<br>
<b>Flag 1000</b> has two meanings, depending on whether its used in a battle trigger or not. For a non-battle trigger, this flag will be set
 to true when a hero owned by a human player visits a map object or is the subject of a trigger such as a timer or level gain check. If a
 computer (AI) hero visits an object, flag 1000 will be set to false. Again, you can set this flag yourself but it's probably safest not to,
 since you may wish to check its value in a script to determine if the subject is a human or AI player.<br>
Therefore, if checking the flag's condition, -1000 means AI and 1000 means Human.<br>
<br>
For battle triggers (e.g., !?BA0, !?BG, !?BF, !?BR, etc.) Flag 1000 is a check for a real vs. theoretical AI battle. <br>
If Flag 1000=1 (True), it means there's a real battle (at least one human opponent).
<br>If Flag 1000=0 (False), it means that it's a theoretical AI-only battle.<br>
<B>
  <u><A name="fshow"></a>Display</A>ing the Value of Flags in Messages</u></B><br>To display the value of a flag (0 or 1) in a message, use
  %F followed by the flag number you wish to display (1 to 1000). So to display flag number 4 within a message, you would use %F4. Displaying
  the value of flags may be useful primarily as a tool to help in debugging scripts.
  <b><font color="#0000FF">Example:</font></b>
  <script type="erm">!!IF:M^The value of flag number 4 is %F4.^;</script>
  
  <B><u><A name="fequal"></a>Comparing</A> Values</u></B><br>
To compare the game parameter to a particular value you can use the following way: ...[compare operator] value... 
The result of comparing is stored in flag 1. You can use its value for further ERM statements.&nbsp;</font></p>

<A name="vintro"></a>Variables are similar to flags in that they can be set and checked, but unlike flags they can hold many more values than true
 and false. In most cases, a variable can be used in place of a number. Also, the contents of a variable (the value it stores) can be changed at
 any time simply by storing a new value in it, hence the name <i>variable</i>. There are also several different types of variables that may be
 used for different purposes or in different places in your code.If a command parameter is shown as $ it means that its value can be stored in
  a variable. If it's shown as # it means that it can only be set, but not read. And if it's shown as ?$ it means it can be read but not set.</A>

  <p align="left"><B><font face="Arial" size="2"><u><A name="vset"></a>Storing Variables</u></font></B><br>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">There are several ways of storing a value in a variable. The <a href="../receiver/revr_r.htm">VR receiver</a>
  can be used to set the value of any variable and can also be used to do arithmetic operations with variables such as adding, subtracting,
  multiplying or dividing. The exception are the z variables which are used to store strings of characters rather than numerical values.<br>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">Example:</font></b> <script type="erm">!!VRv5:S17; stores value 17 to v5</script>
  </b><A name="vget"></a><font face=arial size=2>The second way of storing a value in a variable is to read the value from an object or
  setting in the game, such as number of a hero, the value of a pile of gold, the number of gems that player number 4 currently possesses,
  or the type or subtype of any object. To store a value in this way, immediately after a command, use the question mark symbol (?) followed
  by the variable name in place of a value parameter.<br>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">Examples:</font></b>
  <script type="erm">!!OB10/15/1:T?j; stores the type of an object located at x=10, y=15, level=1 (underground) in the variable j:
!!OW:R3/4/?v12; stores the number of crystals (resource type 4) that the green player (player number 3) currently has, in the  variable v12</script>
<br><font face=arial size=2>The third method of storing a variable is by an indirect reference. A few ERM commands require a number that is the 
<i>index number</i> of a v or z variable. In this case, instead of using the question mark, you simply enter a number for that parameter and the
 value retrieved by the command will be stored in the corresponding variable (e.g., if the command asks for a index number for a v variable,
 putting in 17 would store a value in v17).</font><br>
 <B><u>Using Variables Instead of Numbers</u></B><br>
 Once you have a value stored in a variable, you can use that variable in place of a number in your code. Almost anywhere that you could normally
 enter a number, you can instead use any of the variables, provided the value they hold is within an acceptable range for the command or parameter
 you're using it with. Again, the exception is the z variables which are used when you wish to set or display a string of characters, such as a 
 hero's name, the name of an artifact, or a word or phrase. In most cases it will be fairly obvious when a z variable should be used with a
 command rather than a numeric variable (any of the other variable types).<br>
 <b><font color="#0000FF">Examples:</font></b> <br>
 <script type="erm">!!VRv200:S0R50; [Store random number between 0 and 50 in v200 variable]
 !!HE155:Iv200;</b> [Set hero number 155's spell points to value stored in v200]</script>
 
 <script type="erm">!!VRz50:S^Sir ^;[Store the word "Sir " in the variable z50]
 !!HE-1:B0/?z51; [Store current hero's name in z51]
 !!VRz52:S50 +z51; [Add contents of variable z51 to z50 and store in z52]
 !!HE-1:B0/z52; [Set name of current hero to text stored in variable z52]</script>
 Note: both examples above need to be preceded by a trigger event of some sort in order to function.<br>
 <font color="#000000"><B><u><A name="vcheck"></a>Conditional Statements with Variables</A></u></B><br>
 Like flags, you can use the value of one or more variables to determine if a statement (trigger or receiver) executes. And in fact,
 the syntax is similar. However, instead of putting the flag number (with or without a minus sign in front of it), you would put the name
 of the variable followed by a comparison symbol (=, >, <, <>, >=, or <=) and the number (or variable) you wish to compare it with.</font><b><br>
 <font color="#0000FF">Examples:</font></b><br>
<script type="erm">!!IF&v1>=7:M^You were wise to make that choice, hero!^; This message will only be shown if v1 hold value greater than or equal 7</script>
<script type="erm">!!IF&z1=z2:M^So, you are the one!^; This message will only be shown if strings z1 and z2 contain equal values</script>

  Checking Multiple Variables<br>
  This is accomplished in much the same way as checking multiple flags, by separating subsequent variable tests with the slash symbol (/).
  In fact, you can freely mix and match checks for flags and variables in the same statement, as in the following example: 
  <script type="erm">
  !!HE-1&7/v2>6/-1/y4=v8:A31; this will give the current hero Armor of Wonder only if the following conditions are true:
  ;1. Flag 7 must be true (set to 1)
  ;2. The v2 variable must currently store a value of 6 or higher
  ;3. Flag 1 must be false (set to 0 or not set)
  ;4. The y4 variable must currently store the same value as the v8 variable.</script>
  
  </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Checking syntax - OR conditions.:</u></font><br>
  <script type="erm">!!XX&c1/c2/c3|c4/c5/c6:...; this may be used in instructions or triggers as well</script>
  Full condition is: (c1 AND c2 AND c3) OR c4 OR c5 OR c6<br>
  Comments.- OR section may be alone or only after AND section - if there is only OR section, full condition will be true if at least one OR
  condition is TRUE- there may be up to 16 AND conditions and up to 16 OR conditions<br>
  <u><B><a name=vtypedesc></a>The Different Types of Variables</a></B></u><br>
  As mentioned earlier, there are several different types of variables, each used in a slightly different way or place in your code.
  
  <br><b> The c variable</b> contains the number of the current game day. <br>
  It cannot be used in a conditional expression (e.g., &c=5), so you must first set another variable equal to it and then use that variable 
  in the expression.  It can be used in VR calculations, except for one glitch, subtracting a variable from it:
  <script type = "erm">  !!VRv1:Sc-v2; this gives a syntax error and a wrong result in v1
  !!VRv1:Sv2*-1+c; this version works ok
  !!VRv1:Sc0-v2; adding a zero after the c also works! (maybe c0 was an earlier version of c in WoG?)</script>
  
  <u><span lang="de">Standard</span> variables (f-t) and (v1-v10000)</u> are for the most part
  interchangeable<span lang="de">, but </span>certain commands require an <i>index number</i>  of a v variable to store the results.
  Both types are used for storing numerical integer (whole) numbers.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="hero"></a>Hero variables (w1-w100)</b> store the same type of information as v
  variables, but are unique for each hero. This means that two different heroes could have different values stored in their w1 variable
  (or w2, w10 or anything up to and including w200). In order to set or check one or more w variables you must first set the hero
  number that they apply to by using the IF:W command. For example, if you wish to set or check w5 for hero number 27 (Gem),
  you would first put
  <script type="erm">!!IF:W27;</script>
  prior to the statement that referenced her w5 variable. To specify the current hero, use -1 instead of a number.
  So <script type="erm">!!IF:W-1;</script>
  means that subsequent references to w variables will refer to the current hero (until another IF:W statement is issued).<br>
<i><a name="hero2"></a>Hero variables (w101-w200)</i> that were added in 3.58 version work everywhere that the first 100 w variables
 work except for !!HT:W instruction. In it you can use only the first 100w variables.
<br>
  <span lang="de">See also <a href="../receiver/reif_r.htm#W">IF:W</a> section and <a href="../receiver/revr_r.htm#heroVars">VR</a> section)</span>
  <br><br>
  <b>Function parameter variables (x1-x16)</b> also store the same types of values (numeric) as v and w variables.
  However, these variables only exist within functions (code following a function trigger) and are initially set to
  values passed to the function in the function receiver statement after the P command (P stands for parameter).
  See the <a target=_parent href="../receiver/refu.htm">FU Receiver</a> page for more details on functions.
  If you call a function from within another function, any x variables that aren't set (as new parameters)
  maintain their same values in the new function. When used with the DO receiver, the x16 parameter stores 
  the loop count of the function (i.e., the number of times the function has been executed so far since the
  <a target=_parent href="../receiver/redo.htm">DO Receiver</a> activated).<br>
  <br><b>Function local variables (y1-y100) </b>are similar to x variables in that they are normally only be used within a function.
  However, they are unique to each function, so if you have four different functions, each will have its own set of y variables.
  Like most of the other variables, they store numeric values only. There is also one set of global y variables that may be used outside of
  functions and could be used if you run low on v variables, but be aware that if another trigger (e.g., HL or BA) occurs in the middle 
  of your script, the values of these y variables could be wiped out.<br><br>
  <span lang="de"><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>Function local floating point variables (e1..e100) </b>
  </font></span><font SIZE="2"><font face="Arial">These variables are unique to every function and are initially set to zero at every 
  beginning of funciton. If a function calls another function, these variables are restored, when the called function returns.
  These variables aren't stored in savegame (although you can't save the game inside of function)<br>  
  You may use them to set parameters but the main feature is to useit to calculate floating point expression and then store it to integer variable.
  You can use +,-,* and : commands of VR receiver for e vars in floating point calculations though all numbers should be integer in the expression.
  You can also put e vars in the message with %E# command. In this case only 3 digits after dot is shown. </font>

  <b>String variables (z1-z1000)</b> store strings of characters (one or more) and cannot be used to store numeric values;
  they could store a number as text but that number couldn't be compared or manipulated numerically in any way.
  z variables can be concatenated (joined together) but have a maximum size of 512 characters each.
  They can also be compared to another z variable to see if they match each other exactly. When comparing two z variables for a match,
  the comparison is NOT case-sensitive. So if z1 stores "This" it will match z2 storing "thIS" or any other combination of upper and lower case.
  Leading blank spaces or lines are also ignored in z variable comparisons. The 500 new z variables added in the ERM 2.60 update (WoG 3.57)
  are identical to the original 500, but note that z501-z1000 will <u>not</u> keep their values between different maps. You have to use
  z301-z500 for this purpose.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><b><u>Note:</i></b></u> Since string variables handle text messages, be aware that a string
  cannot contain the</font> <font color="#FF0000"><b>;</b></font>, <font color="#FF0000"><b>^</b></font> characters.

<b>Function local string variables (z-1-z-10) </b>are similar to their y variable counterparts but store string values like z variables.
 If you set one and then call a function or function loop that sets another value, when you return to the original function you will have
 the variable value you set before the function call. However they differ from y variables in that they will keep their value when you initially
 call the function, so they may be used to pass strings to functions, but cannot be used to return values. Like regular z variables,
 they have a maximum size of 512 characters.<br>

  <b>Trigger based variables</b><img src=../images/new.gif width="28" height="11">
  <font face="Arial" size="2">y-1...y-100 are integer vars<br>e-1...e-100 are floating point vars<br>
  You may use them in the same places that you use y and e vars now. <br>Specific features:<br>
1. They are NOT saved in the saved game. Actually every trigger section will run completely and you cannot save and load a game being inside
 a trigger section.<br>
2. These variables are local for every trigger and if even one trigger works out inside another trigger section, 
they will have a different set of variables. As you can see you cannot pass values from trigger to trigger using these variables.<br>
3. All variables are set to 0 at any trigger start, so you can use this as a default value.<br>
4. All functions called from a particular trigger can access and share that trigger's set of variables, since they're trigger-based and not
 function-based.<br>

<br><B>
  <u><A name="vspec"></a>Special Variables</A></u></B><br>There are several variables in ERM that have special significance. Like the flags 1 and
  1000, special variables can still be set by to anything you like at any time, but it is advisable to do with some degree of caution, since
  other commands may make use of them. The v1 variable is occasionally used to store the results of a few commands. This isn't a common 
  occurrence so it can still be used in your scripts, but it's advisable to not use it for long-term storage of a value; in other words,
  don't store a value in v1 if you need to guarantee that it remains unchanged at some later point in the game. The z1 variable is used
  to store the text entered by a player in an extended dialog box. If you don't use extended dialog boxes, you won't need to worry
  about this, but it's still a good idea not to use z1 for long-term storage. The v variable v997 keeps in combat current round's number 
  (see <a href=../other/triger_r.htm#bg target=annexe>!?BG</a> and <a href=../other/triger_r.htm#br target=annexe>!?BR</a> triggers) 
  The v variables v998, v999, and v1000 always store the position of the object or event that a hero is currently visiting when a corresponding
  trigger is used, or in some cases the location of the hero him or herself (for example, the !?HM trigger). It's best to leave these variables
  alone except to compare their values or copy their values to other variables. The x16 variable (used in functions called with the
  <a target=_parent href="../receiver/redo.htm">DO Receiver</a>), stores the current cycle number of the function. For example,
  if the function is being repeated 12 times (from 1 to 12), the first time through, x16 will equal 1, the second time 2 and so on.
  If you change the x16  variable, you can actually "speed up" or "slow down" a function loop, or even exit from it completely by setting
  x16 equal to the end value (or higher) that was specified in the DO receiver.
  <br><br>
  <u>Initializing Variables</u><br>Like flags, all variables begin the game with an initial value of 0. However, also like flags,
  certain variable ranges will NOT be reset between maps without restarting the Heroes game. Again, this is to allow those variables to
  "carry over" their values to another map as part of a multi-map campaign.
  </font><font face="Arial" size="2">When you start a new map, the following variables will be reset to zero (0) or a void string
  "" for z variables: f...t, v1...v500, v1001-v10000, z1...z300, z501-z1000, w1-w50.
  The following variables will retain their current values between games (unless you quit and restart Heroes):
  v501-v1000, z301-z500, w51-w100.</font><br><br>
  <u><A name="vshow"></a>Displaying Variables in Messages</A></u><br>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Like flags, the values of variables may be displayed in messages by using special codes for the type of variable
  followed by the variable number as shown below:
  <script type="erm">!!IF:M^%V#^; Shows a quick or v variable of the specified number. # = f to t or 1 to 10000
  !!IF:M^%W#^;Shows a hero variable of the specified number. # = 1 to 100
  !!IF:M^%X#^;Shows a parameter variable of the specified number. # = 1 to 16
  !!IF:M^%Y#^;Shows a local function variable of the specified number. # = 1 to 100
  !!IF:M^%Z#^;Shows a string variable of the specified number. # = 1 to 500.
  !!IF:M^%$macro$^;Shows a variable associated with the macro name "macro"</script>
  </font>
  <font face="Arial" size="2"> .It's important to note that the code for displaying a variable is always an uppercase letter after the % symbol,
   while a regular variable reference is always a lowercase letter.</font><br>
   <b><font color="#0000FF">Example</b></font>
   showing the value of quick variable j, standard variable v21 and z variable z100 within a message string:
   <script type="erm">!!IF:M^Sorry, %Z100, but you only have %Vj gold left and you need at least %V21 gold to buy this artifact.^;</script>
   </b>Assuming that z100 had previously been used to store  the hero's name (say it's Clancy) and j to store the current player's
  gold (say it's 750) and v21 to store the cost of some artifact in gold (say it's 2000), the message would appear as:<br><b>
  <font color="red">Sorry, Clancy, but you only have 750 gold left and you need at least 2000 gold to buy this artifact.</font><br></b>
  <B><br>
  <u>Including Variables as Part of a String Variable</u></B>
  By using the same commands you use for displaying a variable in a message (see above), you can include a variable as part of a string variable.
  This is handy  way of concatenating strings made up of several z variables and possibly some other variable values all at once. 
  Inside ERM messages (M and Q commands of IF receiver) you can use special syntax:<br>
  "%%" -> "%"<br>
  "%F#" -> current value of # flag.<br>
  "%Vf"..."%Vt" -> current value of corresponding variable.<br>
  "%W1"..."%W200" -> current value of corresponding hero variable.<br>
  "%X1"..."%X16" -> current value of corresponding function parameter.<br>
  "%Y1"..."%Y100" -> current value of corresponding local variable.<br>
  "%Z1"..."%Z1000" -> current value of corresponding string variable.<br>
  "%$macro$" -> macro name of corresponding variable<br>
  "%Dd" -> current day of week"<br>
  %Dw" -> current week"<br>
  %Dm" -> current month"<br>
  %Da" -> current day from beginning of the game"<br>
  %Gc" -> the color of current gamer in text<br>
  <br>
<br><b><font color="#0000FF">Example</font></b> of combining several z variables and v variables together in one z variable:
<script type="erm">!!VRz10:S^Clancy^;  [set z10 to "Clancy"]
!!VRz11:S^green^; [set z11 to "green"]
!!VRz12:S^red^;[set z12 to "red"]
!!VRv25:S1 R999; [store a random number between 1 and 1000 in v25]
!!VRz100:S^%Z10 always wished he had a %Z11 horse but instead he had a bright %Z12 one. He was %V25 years old now and %Z10 had never owned a %Z11 horse in  his life!^; [store text in z100]
!!IF:M^%Z100.^;[display text stored in z100]</script>

  Assuming the random number generated and stored in the v25 variable is 247, the following message would display to the player:<br>
  <b><font color="red">Clancy always wished he had a green horse but instead he had a bright red one.
  He was 247 years old now and Clancy had never owned a green horse in his life!</font><br></b><br>
  
  <u>Indirect Reference of Variables</u>Several receivers requiring map locations (x, y and level values) can be used with an indirect variable
  reference. This is a single number that is the starting index number of consecutive v variables storing the x, y and level
  values to be used. Thus, if you have stored an x value in v100, y value in v101 and level value in v102, you could use the number
  100 in the receiver instead of these values.<br>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">Example</font></b> of using a local event receiver with an indirect reference:<br>
  <script type="erm">!!VRv100:S10; [number to be used for x value]
  !!VRv101:S15; [number to be used for y value]
  !!VRv102:S0; [number to be used for level value]
  !!LE100:M^Strangely, there is no sound of life here.^; [set message of event at location stored in v100, v101, v102 variables] </script>
  <u>Indexed Variables</u>Sometimes it's useful to be able to refer to a variable index (e.g., the number between 1 and 1000 for a v variable)
  with another variable. In this fashion you could use a repeated function loop such as the
  <a target=_parent href="../receiver/redo.htm">DO Receiver</a> to store information in a series of variables. Instead of putting a number after
  the v, you would put another variable and the value it <i>stores</i> would be the number of the v variable.<br>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">Example</font></b> of a referencing a v variable with a y variable:<br>
  <script type="erm">!!VRy10:S7;
  !!VRvy10:S5;
  !!IF:M^The value of v7 is %V7.^;</script>
  </b></font><br>This would display the following:<br>
<b><font color="red">The value of v7 is 5.</font><br></b>
  This is because y10 has the value 7. And vy10 then means v at the index number stored in y10, which in this case is 7.
  Thus v7 stores the value 5.<br><br>
  <u>Macros</u>If you want to be able to refer to a variable by a more meaningful name, you can set up a macro with the MC receiver.
  The macro can then be used almost any place the variable can be used and is interchangeable with the variable. A macro is referenced
  with the name enclosed by dollar signs, e.g., $treasure$. For more information on macros, see <a href="../receiver/remc.htm" target=_parent>
  <span lang="de">MC receiver</span></a> page.<br><br>
  <u>A Guide to Suggested Variable Use</u>You can use any combination of variable numbers you like in your scripts but to make scripts easier
  to keep track of, change or transfer to other maps, it's a good idea to use a series of contiguous index numbers such as v100 through v120
  or any number you need. It's also a good idea to use Quick Variables to only store temporary numbers and to keep the low numbered v and z
  variables also for this purpose, using only higher numbered v variables and z variables for long-term storage of values. Furthermore,
  where possible, it's good to make use of local y variables within functions, thus keeping more non-local variables available for general
  use elsewhere in your map scripts. The hero variables (w variables) will generally only be useful for specific purposes, but use them only
  when the situation arises, since every single hero has their own set.<br><br>
  <u>Using y Variables Outside Functions</u><br>
There is one global set of y vars [1...100]. However every time function trigger is executed, these variables are stored in different
 memory location and set to zero and after last receiver is executed, the y vars are restored to their previous values. You can use this
 global set anywhere.
 <b><font color="#0000FF"> Example:</font> </b>
 <script type="erm">ZVSE
  !#VRy15:S3;
  ....
  !?...;
  !!IF:M^%Y15^; it shows 3

  <b><u><span style="text-transform: uppercase"><a name="heroVR"></a>How to use a Hero's w variables:</span></u></b><br>
  also see <a href="../other/vars_r.htm#heroVars">Flags&Variables</a> section and <a href="../receiver/reif_r.htm#W">IF:W</a> sectionTo use the
  w variables, you first have to use an !!IF command to specify <i>which</i> hero they will apply to (use -1 for current hero). Once you've
  done this command, you don't have to use it again until you switch to another hero (or if you don't know in advance which hero it will apply to).
  Use this command before <i>setting</i>, <i>testing</i>, or <i>checking</i> a w variable. So if you wanted to use w variables with hero #147
  (Dracon), the command would be:<br></font>
<script type="erm">!!IF:W147;</script>
</b>Then you could set the w1 variable in exactly the same way that you would set any other variable.<br>
 Example: Assume you have a Magic Well located at x=10,y=15,level=0. Let's say there is an event located at x=27,y=18,level=0
 If the hero has visited the well, the event will act differently than it would act if the hero hasn't visited it.

<b><u>Tips on generating random numbers<br>
</u></b>
</font>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Let's say you want to generate a number from 1-100, but not 42, 81, or 99. <br>
That's 3 missing numbers, so generate a random number from 1 to 97. Then if it's 42 or greater add 1. Then if it's 81 or greater add 1.
 Then if it's 99 or greater add 1. <br> You now have a random number, with equal probability for each result, that's 1-100, but not 42, 81, or 99.
 <br> You can obviously exclude a range at a time and so on. It takes one line per exclusion, which is what your recursive method takes.
 Only it's faster and not recursive.<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">- So if you want a number from 1-100 excluding 10-19 and 73, you generate a number from 1-89,
 then if it's 10 or greater add 10, then if it's 73 or greater add 1.<br>
- Let's use the same method to generate a number from 1-10, but not 6. So we generate a number from 1-9, and if it's 6 or greater, add 1.<br>
Number from 1-9 -<br>
&nbsp; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9<br>
If 6 or greater add 1 -<br>
&nbsp; 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 10<br>
Each number has the same odds.</font>
