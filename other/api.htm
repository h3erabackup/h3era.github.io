  <tr>
  <td>PROCEDURE WriteAtCode (Count: INTEGER; Src, Dst: POINTER); STDCALL;</td>
  <td>Copies 'Count' bytes from 'Src' address to 'Dst' address.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
  <td> PROCEDURE Hook (HandlerAddr: POINTER; HookType: INTEGER; PatchSize: INTEGER; CodeAddr: POINTER); STDCALL;</td>
  <td>Universal function for adding software hooks in the code. Most convenient mode: HookType = HOOKTYPE_BRIDGE, in which the low-level conversion
  for high-level functions will be generated automatically.

An example of a high-level function:<br>
PROCEDURE Hook_X (Context: PHookHandlerArgs): LONGBOOL; STDCALL;<br>
<br>The function returns a flag that the it is needed to perform iced interceptor code by default. This code should not contain jumps, but can
contain any commands to work with the stack. The high-level interceptor may modify the registers by reference to the structure THookHandlerArgs.
Through it is also possible to modify the return address in original code.</td>
 </tr>

<tr>
<td>PROCEDURE KillThisProcess; STDCALL;</td>
<td>Silently kills the process.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE FatalError (Err: PCHAR); STDCALL;</td>
<td>Shows fatal error message and kills the application.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE RegisterHandler (Handler: TEventHandler; EventName: PCHAR); STDCALL;</td>
<td>Registers a handler for the specified event. The handlers are called in the same order as they were registered. The event list can be viewed 
in the file "Tools\Era\SDK\triggers.txt". Two key events, in which the initialization code of modules and registration of handlers must be
located are: "OnBeforeWoG", "OnAfterWoG".</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PROCEDURE FireEvent (EventName: PCHAR; {n} EventData: POINTER; DataSize: INTEGER); STDCALL;</td>
<td>Generates an event and informs about it to all registered handlers. EventData points to block of parameters of the event (if any), 
and DataSize defines the size of the block. Through this mechanism useful information about the event can be passed to the handlers.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>FUNCTION LoadTxt (Name: PCHAR): {n} PTxtFile; STDCALL;</td>
<td>Loads a text table used by game.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE ForceTxtUnload (Name: PCHAR); STDCALL;</td>
<td>Forces an unloading of text file. Use with caution!</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE ExecErmCmd (CmdStr: PCHAR); STDCALL;</td>
<td>Executes ERM command. Use it without header (XX:X; not !!XX:X;).<br>

Example:<br>
<font face="courier">ExecErmCmd('IF:L^Hello, World!^;');</font></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE ReloadErm; STDCALL;</td>
<td>Reloads ERM scripts. Same as F12 key</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE ExtractErm; STDCALL;</td>
<td>Extracts ERM scripts to "Data\s\ExtractedScripts".</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE FireErmEvent (EventID: INTEGER); STDCALL;</td>
<td>Generates a new ERM event by calling ERM function with the specified number. Such a call does not keep the negative z-variables. The authors
of plug-ins should the previous event parameters (!!SN:X) through the function SaveEventParams before calling FireErmEvent and restore through 
function RestoreEventParams after the call, so each new event has its own set SN: X - parameters.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE ClearIniCache; STDCALL;</td>
<td>Removes all loaded ini files from memory.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> FUNCTION ReadStrFromIni (Key, SectionName, FilePath, Res: PCHAR): BOOLEAN; STDCALL;</td>
<td>Reads a value from the specified ini-file into a buffer Res. At the first reading of the ini-file is analyzed, cached, and further requests 
are routed to values in an associative array. Such reading is very quick and does not access the hard drive.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> FUNCTION WriteStrToIni (Key, Value, SectionName, FilePath: PCHAR): BOOLEAN; STDCALL;</td>
<td>Writes a value to ini file. Each time data is written to hard disk.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE NameColor (Color32: INTEGER; Name: PCHAR); STDCALL;</td>
<td>Allows to give custom names for color codes and later reuse them in dialog texts <br>
Example:<br>
<font face="courier">NameColor($000000, 'bl')</font><br>
allows to use ^{~bl}...{~}^ for black text</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE WriteSavegameSection (DataSize: INTEGER; {n} Data: POINTER; SectionName: PCHAR); STDCALL;</td>
<td>Function must be called in the event "OnSavegameWrite" and is used for recording user data in a file named section. 
Allows only serial recording in the same section.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> FUNCTION ReadSavegameSection (DataSize: INTEGER; {n} Dest: POINTER; SectionName: PCHAR): INTEGER; STDCALL;</td>
<td>Reads the specified section from save game. Must be called at event "OnSavegameRead". Returns number of bytes read.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE GetGameState (VAR GameState: TGameState); STDCALL;</td>
<td>Gets the current state of play as a pair of dialogue IDs: the main parent and current. 0 - dialogues do not yet exist. This is useful to 
determine in which window is the key pressed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE SaveEventParams; STDCALL;</td>
<td>Saves SN:X parameters in an array on stack.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> PROCEDURE RestoreEventParams; STDCALL;</td>
<td>restores SN:X parameters from stack.</td>
</tr>
